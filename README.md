# Repository Overview: Real and Fake Face Detection

This repository contains a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for detecting real and fake faces in images. It includes all necessary files and resources to train, evaluate, and deploy the model for face detection tasks.

## Files Overview

- **dataset**: Contains the training and testing datasets for the model.
- **fake image locations.txt**: A text file containing the locations of fake images in the dataset.
- **model.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the implementation of the deep learning model.
- **model_checkpoint.hdf5**: Saved weights for the trained deep learning model.

## Project Description

### Objective

The goal of this project is to create a deep learning model that can accurately distinguish between real and fake faces in images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

### Requirements

- **Python**: Programming language used for the implementation.
- **Keras**: High-level neural networks API for building the deep learning model.
- **TensorFlow**: Backend framework for training and running the model.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive code execution and model experimentation.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for data visualization.
- **Numpy**: Core library for numerical computations in Python.
